# Face-Detector
Face detector built using the Viola-Jones algorithm and its demonstration on real-world images as a part of ECEN 649 - Pattern Recognition course at TAMU.

This code is written in **Python 3 (3.7.4)** and implemented in a Jupyter notebook (ipython 7.8.0).

## Packages required to implement this algorithm:
- numpy 1.17.3 - used for processing arrays and storing values.
- Pillow 6.2.0 - it is a imaging library used for opening, editing and saving images.
- joblib 0.14.0 - used for creating parallel loops.
- seaborn 0.9.0 - used for creating heatmaps (plots).
- matplotlib 3.1.1 - used for plots and creating rectangles for features.
- scikit-learn 0.21.3 - used to get accuracy and loss.
- Other packages used are included in the python standard library.

The repository can be cloned using:
```
git clone https://github.com/akshayhiregoudar/Face-Detector
```

The entire source code is located in [face_detector.py](face_detector.py)

The jupyter notebook with all the outputs, images, and graphs is located in [face_detector.ipynb](face_detector.ipynb). The notebook has been solved in according to the questions given in the project. It has all the necessary questions (2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) as well as the additional question (2.4.2).
