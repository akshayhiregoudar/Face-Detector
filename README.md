# Face-Detector
Face detector built using the Viola-Jones algorithm and its demonstration on real-world images as a part of ECEN 649 - Pattern Recognition course at TAMU.

This code is written in Python 3.7 and implemented in a Jupyter notebook.

## Packages required to implement this algorithm:
- numpy 1.17.3
- Pillow 6.2.0
- joblib 0.14.0
- seaborn 0.9.0
- matplotlib 3.1.1
- pickleshare 0.7.5
- scikit-learn 0.21.3

The repository can be cloned using 
```
git clone https://github.com/akshayhiregoudar/Face-Detector
```

The source code can is located in [face_detect.py](face-detect.py)

The jupyter notebook with all the outputs, images, and graphs is located in [face-detect.ipynb](face-detect.ipynb). The notebook has been solved in according to the questions given in the project. It has all the necessary questions (2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) as well as the additional question (2.4.2).
